[{"content":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Wefdzen! ðŸ‘‹ I decided to start this blog to share my thoughts, findings, and experiences. I\u0026rsquo;m passionate about backend development and currently learning Golang. Of course, everything related to servers, databases, architecture, and optimization also interests me.\nWhat will this blog be about? I plan to write about:\nGolang â€“ interesting solutions, pitfalls, and cool language features. Backend development â€“ architecture, databases, caching, APIs, and microservices. Useful tools â€“ those that help code faster and better. A bit of personal life â€“ occasional thoughts, experiences, or just something interesting outside of coding. Why am I doing this? To solidify my knowledge â€“ writing helps me understand topics better. To share experiences â€“ maybe my notes will be useful to someone. To grow this blog â€“ over time, it might turn into something great. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in these topics â€“ welcome aboard! Expect a lot of content about coding, practice, and real-world cases. ðŸ’»\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/posts/post1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"hi-im-wefdzen-\"\u003eHi, I\u0026rsquo;m Wefdzen! ðŸ‘‹\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI decided to start this blog to share my thoughts, findings, and experiences.
