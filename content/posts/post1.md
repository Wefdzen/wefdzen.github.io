## Hi, I'm Wefdzen! ðŸ‘‹

I decided to start this blog to share my thoughts, findings, and experiences. I'm passionate about **backend development** and currently learning **Golang**. Of course, everything related to servers, databases, architecture, and optimization also interests me.

## What will this blog be about?

I plan to write about:

-   **Golang** â€“ interesting solutions, pitfalls, and cool language features.
-   **Backend development** â€“ architecture, databases, caching, APIs, and microservices.
-   **Useful tools** â€“ those that help code faster and better.
-   **A bit of personal life** â€“ occasional thoughts, experiences, or just something interesting outside of coding.

## Why am I doing this?

1. **To solidify my knowledge** â€“ writing helps me understand topics better.
2. **To share experiences** â€“ maybe my notes will be useful to someone.
3. **To grow this blog** â€“ over time, it might turn into something great.

If you're interested in these topics â€“ welcome aboard! Expect a lot of content about coding, practice, and real-world cases. ðŸ’»
